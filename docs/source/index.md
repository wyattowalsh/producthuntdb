## Start Here

ProductHuntDB is a production-grade data pipeline for harvesting, storing, and publishing Product Hunt data with SQLite and Kaggle. It ships with opinionated defaults, type-checked settings, and a Typer-powered CLI.

```{note}
**Release status**: v0.1.0 (October 30, 2025) · Test coverage gate: **≥88%** · Python 3.11+ · Managed by `uv`.
```

### Key Capabilities

- **Full GraphQL coverage** – mirror all public Product Hunt entities with referential integrity.
- **SQLite-first storage** – tuned indices, migration tooling via Alembic, and repeatable exports.
- **Kaggle automation** – publish-ready datasets with credential-aware workflows.
- **Observability hooks** – structured Loguru logging, safety buffers, and retry-aware API clients.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wyattowalsh/producthuntdb.git
cd producthuntdb

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Configure credentials
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set PRODUCTHUNT_TOKEN

# Initialize and verify the pipeline

### Keeping Docs Healthy

- Run `make docs` and `sphinx-build -b linkcheck docs/source docs/build/linkcheck` before publishing.
- Document new CLI commands and settings with docstrings—autodoc pages pull descriptions directly from code.
- Update the **Style Guide** when adding new content patterns, terminology, or iconography.

### Community & Feedback

- File issues or feature requests on GitHub.
- Join discussions via pull requests that touch `docs/`.
- Contributions should follow the doc style guide, pass link checks, and respect the 88% coverage threshold.
