## Overview

Tenacity is a lightweight library for adding retries with configurable stop/wait strategies and failure handling.

## How ProductHuntDB Uses Tenacity

- Retry HTTP requests to Product Hunt API and transient DB operations.
- Use exponential backoff with jitter for rate-limited endpoints.

### Example

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(5), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=30))
def fetch_data():
    # network call
    pass
```

## Best Practices

- Keep retries idempotent or ensure operations are safe to repeat.
- Use backoff+jitter to avoid thundering herds.
- Limit total retry time for long-running operations.
